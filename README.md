# Dynamic Phasors Study Repo

This repository contains simulation-based studies on dynamic phasors, supervised by **Dr. Gus**.

The project goes a bit beyond the standard university coursework and is run as an individual study, with the aim of digging deeper into dynamic phasors, which are one of the key concepts in modern circuit and power-electronics analysis.

The code and reports explore:

- How circuit simulation can be formulated using **time-domain differential equations** and **complex matrix representations**.
- How **dynamic phasor models** are derived from these equations and how they relate to classical phasor and steady-state analysis.
- How different power transfer functions and node equations can be used to analyse and compare circuits in both the time and phasor domains.

For more details, please refer to the reports and notebooks included in this repository.
