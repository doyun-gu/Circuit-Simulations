# Circuit Simulation Development Project

This repository contains a circuit simulation research project conducted by **Doyun Gu** under the supervision of **Dr. Gus Cheng Zhang** at **The University of Manchester**.

The project focuses on:
- Applying **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)** to circuit simulation
- Investigating the behaviour of **dynamic phasors** in switching RLC circuits
- Improving the **accuracy and efficiency** of circuit simulation methods for power electronic systems

**Supervisor:**
